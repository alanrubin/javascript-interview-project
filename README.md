# JS Interview Project (React or Angular)
This is a small project for a JavaScript interview.

## Goal
Create an UI web application that retrieves and displays the user repositories and organisations in Github.

## UX/UI
Up to you, probably it should include an input to enter the username, one area to display the repositories of the user and another area to display the organisations

## Retrieving data
To make things easier we have commited a github-api.js file with the REST APIs needed to retrieve the information.

## Bootstrapping the project
Up to you, for React we recommend [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Submitting the solution
Copy this repository to a repository on your name and add the solution there. It should be clear how to build and run the project locally. **Please don't FORK this repo**

## Bonus (don't need to be in the below specific order)
* Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
* Adding types with Flow or Typescript
* Adding a spinner when information is loading
* Deal with errors coming from the backend
* Some sort of Unit Test
* Some sort of Integration Test
* Having a nice UI using a components library (Bootstrap, Ant Design, Material UI or another?)
* Divide the application in different pages and use a router
* Adding state management if relevant (REACT: additional Bonus if using Mobx or Mobx-State-Tree instead of Redux)
* Show common tools used for you daily development environment (linters, code formatter, git workflow, docker and so on)
* Deploy the project somewhere
